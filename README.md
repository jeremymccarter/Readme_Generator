## Description
This application will ask prompts that help the user create a readme for whatever application they may be working on. This will all be ran through the command line and will create the .md file on completion.

  ##  Installation
The user will need a text editor and the computers command line. They will also need to have node, and inquirer installed. 
Once the user pulls up the command line, they will need to make sure they have the proper packages installed using "node i". Once
that is installed the user can run "node index" and the command line will fill with the proper prompts!
  

  ## Intended usage
  This will help the user make a thorough and complete readme in an expedited fashion.
